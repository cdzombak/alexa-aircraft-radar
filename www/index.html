      <h1>Aircraft Radar skill for Amazon Alexa</h1>
      <blockquote class="main-quote">“Alexa, ask Aircraft Radar what’s nearby.”</blockquote>

      <p class="main-p"><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XC9L9H/">Aircraft Radar</a></strong> uses live <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_–_broadcast">ADS-B</a>
        radio signals, collected by volunteers, to tell you what airplanes are around you.</p>

      <p>You can ask it “Alexa, ask <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XC9L9H/">Aircraft Radar</a> …”:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“what airplanes are around?”</li>
        <li>“what jets are overhead?”</li>
        <li>“what was that?”</li>
        <li>“are there any helicopters nearby?”</li>
        <li>“what’s the nearest aircraft?”</li>
        <li>“are there any military planes around?”</li>
        <li>…and more!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p><strong>Click “Enable Skill” on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XC9L9H/">the Aircraft Radar skill page</a>,</strong> or ask
        Alexa to “enable the Aircraft Radar skill”.</p>

      <p>This skill requires your Echo to have an address assigned to it, and you’ll need to give Aircraft Radar permission in the Alexa app to access your address. (<a href="permission.png" target="_blank">Here’s a screenshot</a>
        showing that configuration in the Alexa app.)</p>

      <h2>Ask Questions</h2>

      <p>You can ask Aircraft Radar for airplanes that are “nearby,” “around,” or similar words. It looks for aircraft within
        40km of you. Aircraft Radar will tell you about the nearest aircraft
        that match your search. If there are more than a few, it’ll tell you about the first 3 or 4 and then ask you if you want to hear the rest.</p>

      <p>You can also ask for <em>just</em> the nearest aircraft — for example, “Alexa, ask Aircraft Radar, what’s the nearest airplane” — instead of asking what’s nearby.
        This will return only one result, and it’ll include more details (like the plane’s registration number, and the destination airport and a photo, if Aircraft Radar can find those.)</p>

      <p>Finally, you can search for jets, helicopters, or military aircraft. So, instead of asking “what aircraft are nearby,” you
        might ask “Alexa, ask Aircraft Radar what jets are around” or “what helicopters are overhead.”</p>

      <h2>Data &amp; Accuracy</h2>

      <p>Data from <a href="http://www.adsbexchange.com/">ADS-B Exchange</a> makes this skill possible.
        <strong>Please consider <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/donate/">donating to ADS-B Exchange</a></strong> if you enjoy Aircraft Radar.</p>

      <p>Be aware that not all airplanes transmit ADS-B data just yet, and not all geographical areas have a volunteer receiving
        ADS-B radio transmissions from nearby aircraft. Consider <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/how-to-feed/">running your own receiver and
        feeding the results to ADS-B Exchange</a> if you want to help improve this skill in your geographical area.</p>

      <h2>Donate</h2>

      <p>I pay for a small <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> server,
        which provides a critical caching layer for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XC9L9H/">Aircraft Radar</a> skill. I also send a monthly payment to ADS-B Exchange.</p>

      <p>Please donate as little as you’d like toward these costs via:</p>
